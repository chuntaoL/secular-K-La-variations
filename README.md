# secular-K-La-variations
Here, MATLAB codes are presented for calculation of secular K/La ratios of continental volcanic and plutonic rocks.
Some notes for running matlab code:
1. put supplementary files (Table S-3 and S-4)  and code files in the same folder at MATLAB；
2. Using these codes, you can reproduce results in Fig. 2a.
