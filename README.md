# secular-K-La-variations
Here, MATLAB codes are presented for calculation of secular K/La ratios of continental volcanic and plutonic rocks.
Some notes for running matlab code:
1. put supplementary files (SM_Table 2 and SM_Table 3)  and code files in the same folder at MATLABï¼›
2. Using these codes, you can reproduce results in Fig. 2a.
