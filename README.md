Here, MATLAB codes are presented for calculation of secular K/La ratios of continental volcanic and plutonic rocks.
Some notes for running matlab code:
1. put supplementary files (Data S2 and Data S3)  and code files in the same folder at MATLABï¼›
2. Using these codes, you can reproduce results in Fig. 2A.
